# CloudBees Ci Traditional HA/HS (active/active) Demo Lab Environment

Docker compose setup for a [Cloudbees CI traditional installation](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/traditional-install-guide/) in [HA (active/active) mode](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/ha/ha-fundamentals)

See these links for the background details

* https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/ha/ha-fundamentals

# Architecture

The docker-compose setup for the HA/HS demo follows the design below.
Each CloudBees component as well as the HAProxy is running in a dedicated docker container orchestrated by docker-compose.

The demo has the following limitations:

* The NFS server is not part of the demo. Instead, we will use a single shared local directory on the host system for the JENKINS_HOME directory referenced by the Controller replicas.

Two models are supported: 

## HTTP  (All traffic plain on HTTP port 80 and 8080)

![HTTP-HAProxy-Cjoc.png](docs/HTTP-HAProxy-Cjoc.png)

## HTTPS  (All traffic on HTTPS port 443 and 8443)

![HTTPS-HAProxy-Cjoc.png](docs/HTTPS-HAProxy-Cjoc.png)

The setup consists of the following containers:

* Operations Center
* Controller 1
* Controller 2
* SSH-Agent 1
* HAProxy Load Balancer
* Optional: Linux box with Firefox accessible via VNC from an external browser

The setup is self-sufficient and does not require any modifications on the Docker host or anywhere else outside of the docker compose environment.
There are two exceptions to highlight:

* Persistence
  * Local paths on the docker host are used as persistence volumes.  
  * Controller 1 and Controller 2 share the same $JENKINS_HOME dir.
  * NFS volumes are not used at the moment in the demo lab.
* Browser access
  * If you want to access the demo via a browser from a Docker host, you need entries in `/etc/hosts` (see chapters below)
  * If you don't want to add entries in `/etc/hosts`, you can access a browser in a container under [htpp://localhost:3000](htpp://localhost:3000). No changes on your Docker host system are required in this case


The Operations Center and both controllers are behind HAProxy.

* If a request comes to HAProxy with $OC_URL host header, it is forwarded to the Operations Center container
* If a request comes with $CLIENTS_URL host header, it is load balanced between all client controllers
* The load balancing for client controllers has sticky sessions enabled

# Pre-requirements /tools

* MacOs 14.7
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
  * Tested: 4.24.0 (122432)
* Engine: 24.0.6
* Compose: v2.22.0-desktop.2
* Docker-compose v3
* Web browsers, Firefox, and Chrome has been tested
* ping (not mandatory, but used in the `up.sh` script to test name resolution)
* ssh-keygen (`up.sh`  generates a ssh private and public key used by the ssh build agent)
* Optional: Add a CloudBees Wildcard License to avoid the license screen.
  * If you don't have a license now ignore these sub steps, you can request a trial license later in the Operations Center welcome screen
  * If you have a CloudBees wildcard license, create the following files and add the licence certificate and key there
   ```
    mkdir secrets
    touch secrets/cb-wildcard-license.cert # Add the license certificate  
    touch secrets/cb-wildcard-license.key  # Add the license key
  ```
* Optional: When using Browser on Docker Host (your Laptop)
  * This option requires changes on your host in `/etc/hosts`
  * See for details: [Use your Browser on your Docker Host](#Option2_Use_your_browser_on_your_docker_host)
* Optional: When running in HTTPS Mode: Create a self singed certificate
  * Create a self singed certificate: [ssl/01-createSelfSigned.sh](ssl/01-createSelfSigned.sh)
    * `cd ssl && ./ssl/01-createSelfSigned.sh`
    * requires:   
      * openssl (to create a self signed certificate)
      * Environment variable: JAVA_HOME referencing to a supported jdk (currently java 17)
  * Optional: To make the certificate trusted see [When-using-self-singed-certificate-(HTTPS-mode)](###Option:-When-using-self-singed-certificate-(HTTPS-mode))

# Quick Start

* Clone this repository
  * cd into the directory 
    * `cd ci-traditional-ha`
  * Update the permissions
    * `chmod -R a+x *.sh`
* Start the containers
  * Option HTTP mode:  Run `./up.sh` to start in HTTP mode (no ssl certificates are required)
  * Option HTTPS mode: Run `./up.sh ssl=true` to start in HTTPS mode. See pre requirements: create s self singed certificate first
* The following steps will be executed by the `up.sh` script
  * The persistent volumes will be created 
  * The related containers will start now. This might take some minutes because the required containers get pulled the first time to your docker host
  * All the configuration required by HA/HS is already set up
  * When Docker Compose is fully up, you will be redirected to one of this browser options:
    * Option1: Use a Browser in a box
      * This option doesn't require changes on your host in `/etc/hosts`
      * See for details: [Join the containerized browser in a Box](#Option1_Join_the_containerized_browser_in_a_Box)
    * Option2: Use your Browser on your computer (Docker Host)
      * This option requires changes on your host in `/etc/hosts`
      * See for details: [Use your Browser on your Docker Host](#Option2_Use_your_browser_on_your_docker_host)
* In one of the browser options, open the Operations Center: [http://oc.ha](http://oc.ha) (or for HTTPS mode [https://oc.ha](https://oc.ha))
  * use `admin/admin` for login
  * If not done earlier, request a license (first option in the screen "Request trial license")
  * Click on the pre-provisioned controller "ha" in the Operations Center UI
    * Add `http://client.ha` (or `https://client.ha` in HTTPS mode)
    * Click `push configuration` 
    * Click `join operations center`
* Now you are on a Controller running in HA/HS mode. 
  * A test Pipeline job using an SSH agent is already setup by CasC
    * Click "Build now" amd see the Pipeline log
    * See also the content in the [test](test) directory
  * It takes some minutes until the second Controller joins, see also [http://client.ha/manage/highAvailability](http://client.ha/manage/highAvailability)

[docker-compose.yaml.template](docker-compose.yaml.template)

This template is used to render the `docker-compose.yaml` file using the environment variables in `env.sh`. Please do not modify docker-compose.yaml directly since it will be overwritten by `up.sh`. Instead, modify this template.

[up.sh](up.sh)

A helper script to:

- Create the persistence volumes

Optional, add your CloudBees Wildcard license cert and key.
This is optional. If a wildcard license is supplied you will pass the license welcome screen on the Operations Center

* secrets/cb-wildcard-license.key
* secrets/cb-wildcard-license.cert

An SSH key will also be generated into the `secrets` directory for you when you run the  `up.sh`script
* This key will be injected automatic by casc into the Controllers SSH Credential 
* The public key will be propagated to the Agents `authorized_keys` file

# Steps

## Start/Deploy

- Examine `env.sh` and modify if needed.
- Examine `docker-compose.yaml.template` and modify if needed.
- Run `up.sh` (or `up.sh ssl=true`)
- Wait until all components are up and access via one of the browser options

## Stop

Run `down.sh`. This will issue docker compose down to stop the running containers.

## Clean up

- Stop the running containers using `down.sh`. Then,
- Run `deleteVolumes.sh`. This will delete the persistence directories on the host (docker volumes)

## Browser Access

Just Firefox and Chrome have been tested to access the environment.
There are two options on how to access the CloudBess CI demo lab:

### Option1_Join_the_containerized_browser_in_a_Box

* open a browser on your host machine and point it to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
* This will open a VNC session to the Linux container with a Firefox browser.
* From the start menu (Top to the left) open Firefox browser.

![ff-box](docs/ff-box.png)

* open `http://oc.ha`

### Option2_Use_your_browser_on_your_docker_host

* Add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file

> 127.0.0.1	localhost oc.ha client.ha

* Then open Firefox/Chrome on your PC: [http://oc.ha](http://oc.ha) / or  [https://oc.ha](https://oc.ha)
* Optional (if you can not resolve the hostnames): Flush the DNS cache (MacOs)

> sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

## Open the Operations Center

* Point the browser to http(s)://$OC_URL  (by default this is http://oc.ha/)
* (Not required when using CasC) Unlock the Operations Center, you will find the key in the docker-compose logs on your console
* (Not required when using CasC) You can use this command to get the password

```
docker-compose exec operations-center   cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

![oc-unlock.png](docs/oc-unlock.png)

* Request a license and add admin user details
* (Not required when using CasC)  Install the suggested Plugins
* (Not required when using CasC)  Under Operations Center -> Manage Jenkins -> Security
  * Disable TCP Port 50000 (we don't need it, all traffic in this demo is HTTP or SSH)

![oc-disable50000.png](docs/oc-disable50000.png)

* (Not required when using CasC) Enforce Security realm and SSO

![oc-enforce-security.png](docs/oc-enforce-security.png)

## Create a client controller item

* (Not required when using CasC) Create a client controller item in the Operations Center.
* (Not required when using CasC) Ensure you have "WebSocket" enabled in the connection configuration

![Screenshot20240919at084705.png](docs/image3.png)
![oc-pushconnectiondetails.png](docs/oc-pushconnectiondetails.png)
![Screenshot20240919at084705.png](docs/image2.png)

* Required: Push the configuration to http://$CLIENTS_URL  (by default this is http://client.ha/ )
  * Not required: Try to access http://$CLIENTS_URL/ in Firefox
  * Not required: Request a license and add admin user details
* (Not required when using CasC) Get the Controller1 initial password

> docker-compose exec ha-client-controller-1    cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

* (Not required when using CasC) Install HA plugin (active/active) on http://$CLIENTS_URL/

![controller-installhaplugin.png](docs/controller-installhaplugin.png)

* (Not required when using CasC)The two replicas must be restarted.

  ```
  ./restartControllers.sh
  ```
or 

  ```
  docker-compose restart ha-client-controller-1
  docker-compose restart ha-client-controller-2
  ```

* Controller 2 will begin starting when Controller 1 is ready
* It takes some minutes now, you can see the HA status in the controllers` Manage Jenkins section

![Screenshot20240919at084705.png](docs/image1.png)

## On the controller: Create a Jenkins SSH credential

Note: Not required when using CasC

Join the Controller and add an SSH Credentials (private key)

![controller-ssh-cred.png](docs/controller-ssh-cred.png)

## Create a SSH Agent Node

Note: Not required when using CasC

![createSSHAgent.png](docs/createSSHAgent.png)

## Test Pipeline

see also  [test/README.md](test/README.md])

Note: Not required when using CasC

Once the SSH Agent has been created you can create a simple Test Pipeline on the HA Controller

[test/Jenkinsfile-ssh-agent.groovy](test/Jenkinsfile-ssh-agent.groovy)

Once the Pipeline is started you can  demo one replica to demo the build will take over to the other replica and continue to run if the controller replica is shut down

* Start the Pipeline
* Check what replica you are running on
* Enable HA developer mode to show the info icon at the bottom of the Controller
* This shows you also the IP address of your session replica
* shut your controller replica down (see in `docker-compose.yaml` for the IP address mapped to the docker container name)

```
docker-compose stop ha-client-controller-1 # or ha-client-controller-2 depending on where yu are 
```

* Reload the Controller page in your browser, you should now be on the other replica and the job should resume work

# Troubleshooting

## HA/HS Trouble shooting

* https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/troubleshooting/install-ha-active-active#_troubleshoot_cloudbees_ci_on_traditional_platforms_installations 

## Reconnect Controllers to CJOC 

Ü https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci-kb/latest/operations-center/how-do-i-reconnect-a-controller-to-joc-after-changing-joc-to-https#_if_client_controller_is_not_accessible_from_the_ui 

## curl to inspect headers

To show only headers using a GET request (with no body):

```
source ./env.sh
curl -u ${CJOC_LOGIN_USER}:${CJOC_LOGIN_PW} -s -D - ${CLIENTS_URL} -o /dev/null
curl -u ${CJOC_LOGIN_USER}:${CJOC_LOGIN_PW} -s -D - ${CJOC_URL} -o /dev/null
```
To get both the headers and body of the response:
Use the -v (verbose) option or -i (include headers in the output):

``` 
source ./env.sh
curl -u ${CJOC_LOGIN_USER}:${CJOC_LOGIN_PW} -i -v  ${CLIENTS_URL} -o /dev/null
curl -u ${CJOC_LOGIN_USER}:${CJOC_LOGIN_PW} -i -v  ${CJOC_URL} -o /dev/null
```

Send custom host header

```
source ./env.sh
curl -u ${CJOC_LOGIN_USER}:${CJOC_LOGIN_PW}  -v -H "Host: custom.example.com" ${CLIENTS_URL} -o /dev/null
curl -u ${CJOC_LOGIN_USER}:${CJOC_LOGIN_PW}  -v -H "Host: custom.example.com" ${CJOC_URL} -o /dev/null
```

## Browser shows SSL issues or side is not secured/Missing SSL Certificate

If you hit SSL issues in your browser when you access the Operations Center, do the following:

### Option:-When-using-self-singed-certificate-(HTTPS-mode)

To make the certificate trusted in your browser: 

* [Add the certificate to your Keychain Access](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/add-certificates-to-a-keychain-kyca2431/mac)
* Import the certificate into MacOs "Keychain Access"
* Once imported: click the certificate and select  "Always trusted" 

![keychainaccess.png](docs/keychainaccess.png)

![keychainaccess-trust.png](docs/keychainaccess-trust.png)

### Option: When not using self singed certificates: Disable "HTTPS Only" mode

If you hit SSL cert issues in your browser, do the following:

(I haven't checked yet how to do this in Chrome)

* use Firefox with disabled `HTTPS only mode` see https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs
* Adjust the following exceptions:

Under Firefox settings search "HTTPS Only"

Disable HTTPS only:

![ff-https-only](docs/ff-httpsonly.png)

Add exceptions:

![ff-exceptions](docs/ff-exceptions.png)

# Extra Notes used during development of the demo (Not required for the setup)

## DNS Flush (MacOs)

> sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

## Useful Docker commands

### Inspect network

```
docker network ls
docker network inspect traditional-ha_demo-network
```

### Restart container

```
docker-compose restart <container>
```

Example:

```
docker-compose restart ha-client-controller-1
docker-compose restart ha-client-controller-2
```

### List docker processes

```
docker-compose top
```

## Details SSH Agents

### Create your SSH keys

> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com"

### Add your public key to the agent container

add the ssh-pub key in your `docker-compose.yaml` file

```
    environment:
      - JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY="YOUR_PUB_KEY"

```

Restart the agent container if required

> docker-compose restart agent

Verify if the key has been applied: (Join the docker agent container and check the `/home/jenkins/.ssh` directory)
